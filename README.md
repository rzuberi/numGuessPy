# numGuessPy
A number guessing game in Python 3

The source code for the game.py class is largely based on this tutorial: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-guessing-game-in-python/

To play:
The game.py class it the classic number guessing game. Once launched, the console asks you for a lower and a higher bound. You then have a number of guesses determined by these boundaries. You can then start guessing and if you guess the number determined by the computer, you win, and if you use all your guesses without guessing the correct number, you lose.

The gameBot.py class lets you define the rules for a bot to play the game for you. Once launched, still in the console, you set a lower and higher boundary, you choose a number for the bot to guess, you set the number of guesses for the bot (could be infinite). Then, you can watch all of his guesses get displayed in the console until he wins or loses.
